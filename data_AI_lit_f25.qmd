# Data literacy: The ability to **read**, **evaluate**, and **construct** arguments with data.

## Data literacy


<br>

::: {.fragment .fade-up .midi}
It is not the same as mathematical literacy.

So, regardless of your math background, you can develop excellent data critical thinking skills!

# Example: COVID Prevalence

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Example: Visualizing COVID Prevalence {.smaller}

In May of 2020, the Georgia Department of Public Health posted the following graph:

![](img/GAcovid.jpg){width="50%" fig-align="center"}

-   At a quick first glance, what story does the Georgia Department of Public Health graph appear to be telling?

-   What is misleading about the Georgia Department of Public Health graph? How could we fix this issue?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Example: Visualizing COVID Prevalence {.smaller}

After public outcry, the Georgia Department of Public Health said they made a mistake and posted the following updated graph:

![](img/GAcovid2.jpg){fig-align="center" width="40%"}

-   How do your conclusions about COVID-19 cases in Georgia change when now interpreting this new graph?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Example: Visualizing COVID Prevalence {.smaller}

Alberto Cairo, a journalist and designer, created the second graph of the Georgia COVID-19 data:

::: {.fragment .midi}
![](img/GAcovid2.jpg){width="40%"} ![](img/GAcovid_cairo.png){width="40%"}
:::

-   A key principle of data visualization is to **"help the viewer make meaningful comparisons"**.

-   What comparisons are made easy by the lefthand graph? What about by the righthand graph?

-   From these graphs, can we get an accurate estimate of the COVID prevalence in these Georgian counties over this two week period?

-   What are the pros of using wastewater over nasal swabs to assess COVID prevalence? What are the cons?

-   The graph also incorporates **uncertainty measures**. Quantifying uncertainty is a key component of data literacy.

## AI and the Classroom

::: columns
::: {.column width="80%"}

> "AI promises compelling benefits—such as saving time in busy lives and helping your work to appear more creative or clever—but there are many important but invisible tradeoffs in using it, especially in the classroom. Therefore, at least in school, **there’s good reason not to use or rely on AI/LLMs while you’re still learning new skills and growing as a person**, even if it’s ok to use it in future jobs where producing work is more important than learning." -- Patrick Lin, Philosophy Professor at Cal Poly

* Make sure you are having conversations with your professors about what is and is not appropriate use of GenAI in your classes.
    + Policies will vary from class to class.

---

## Ethical use of GenAI

* You evaluate the relevance, usefulness, and accuracy of GenAI outputs.

* You understand the potential harms of GenAI.
    + On the environment.
    + On the labor market.
    + On society.

* You examine the privacy and data security risks of GenAI.

* You credit GenAI contributions in your work through appropriate citations.


---

## Prompt Engineering

* Write an effective prompt is tough.

* Need to practice and refine our prompts to achieve better outcomes from GenAI.

## Developing your Data & AI Literacy at Bucknell

-   About developing **reasoning**

    -   Not just learning definitions and formulae
    -   Not just memorizing arbitrary rules (p-value $<$ 0.05, sample size $>$ 30)
    -   Consider the appropriateness of AI for the task at hand.
    
    
-   Requires **judgment** that takes time to develop

    -   Lots of great classes at Bucknell to start practicing:
        - MATH 216: Statistics I
        - DATA 100: Introduction to Data Science (will be offered for the first time this spring)

## AI Talk: Data Science in the Age of AI: AI is the Engine & You are the Engineer

Thursday, November 6th noon - 12:50pm, Taylor 208, Food provided

::: columns
::: {.column width="85%"}

> Generative AI tools are a game-changer for complex data science projects.  They can accelerate a project from 0 to 80% complete in a remarkably short amount of time, but the final 20% still demands the skills of a human data scientist to create a robust, nuanced, and context-specific solution.  

> In this talk, I will walk through several projects I have completed with the help of large language models.  With each project, I will show you how to construct tasks for AI and which components require human expertise.  My goal is to help you think through the role of the human in data science work and the AI skills you should be developing while you are here at Bucknell and how these skills will prepare you to adapt and stay ahead in the rapidly evolving world after you leave Bucknell.
