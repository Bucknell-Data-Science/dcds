    "text": "AI Talk: Data Science in the Age of AI: AI is the Engine & You are the Engineer\nThursday, November 6th noon - 12:50pm, Taylor 208, Food provided\n\n\n\nGenerative AI tools are a game-changer for complex data science projects. They can accelerate a project from 0 to 80% complete in a remarkably short amount of time, but the final 20% still demands the skills of a human data scientist to create a robust, nuanced, and context-specific solution.\n\n\nIn this talk, I will walk through several projects I have completed with the help of large language models. With each project, I will show you how to construct tasks for AI and which components require human expertise. My goal is to help you think through the role of the human in data science work and the AI skills you should be developing while you are here at Bucknell and how these skills will prepare you to adapt and stay ahead in the rapidly evolving world after you leave Bucknell.\n\n\n\nGuest Speaker: Chester Ismay"
