## Sharing Code



How do you share code?



::: {.fragment}


* `R` scripts and `R` Markdown/Quarto documents
* RStudio Projects
* GitHub Repository
* R Package

## When To Create an `R` Package?

* If you have certain recurring operations that occur across multiple projects.
* Want to share data and documentation and not worry about file paths, file types, the documentation getting lost...

* **BUT**, you will still use an RStudio Project (with a corresponding GitHub repo) for the code and data that are specific to a given project.

## R Packages


> "R packages are the fundamental unit of R-ness". -- Jenny Bryan



* Contains functions, (possibly) datasets, documentation, and tests.  

* "base R": 14 base packages that are preloaded
    + There are 15 other packages that also come preloaded.

* CRAN has > 19,000 more packages
    + `install.packages("dplyr")`
    + `library(dplyr)`

* And then there are all the packages on `GitHub`:
    + `pak::pak("tidyverse/dplyr")`
    + `library(dplyr)`


---

## R Data Packages

* Great way to share data!
    
    
* Example 1:
    + `library(mosaicData)`
    + `data(package = "mosaicData")`
    + `?Births2015`



* Example 2:    
    + `library(pdxTrees)`
    + `get_pdxTrees_parks()`
    + `get_pdxTrees_streets()`


* Example 3: 
    + `library(palmerpenguins)`

## R Packages

### Why create an R package?

* Very portable.
* Includes documentation.
* Provides a useful structure for organizing your work:
    + `R` folder: Code
    + `tests` folder: Testing functions
    + `data` folder: Storing data
* Lots of helper functions in other packages to automate parts of the process.

## Creating an R Package

Key packages: 

* [`devtools`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html): supports the development and dissemination of the package

* [`usethis`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/): automates steps of package creation, such as constructing the data file

* [`roxygen2`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/roxygen2.html): simplifies writing documentation

## Let's Create an R Package!

Will focus on dog names in Cambridge, MA because I couldn't find a corresponding PA version of this data...

### Our Package: `camDogs`

**Goals**: 

* Share the [Dogs of Cambridge dataset](https://data.cambridgema.gov/General-Government/Dogs-of-Cambridge/sckh-3xyx), along with documentation.
* Create a function that outputs a dataset of the dogs with the 10 most common names.

* Useful MVP code:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
camDogs <- read_csv("https://data.cambridgema.gov/api/views/sckh-3xyx/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD")

camDogs <- mutate(camDogs,
               Breed = if_else(Dog_Breed == "Mixed Breed",
                               "Mixed", "Single"))

top10 <- function(data, x){

  # Find the 10 top based on x
  top10x <- count(data, {{x}}) %>%
    slice_max(n = 10, order_by = n) %>%
    select({{x}}) %>%
    pull()

   # Filter dataset to only the 10 top based on x
  return(filter(data, {{x}} %in% top10x))
}
```

### Steps

* Let's go through the ["Creating an R Package" hand-out](https://bucknell-data-science.github.io/dcds/pdfs/R_package_handout.pdf).

* I will demo the process with [this Dogs of Cambridge dataset](https://data.cambridgema.gov/General-Government/Dogs-of-Cambridge/sckh-3xyx).
